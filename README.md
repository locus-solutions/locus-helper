## Notes
- There are some modules missing, you can still start the bot but there are some things within the source that you will not be able to use
- If you would like to contribute to the missing modules, contact me through one of [these](https://github.com/synesta/locus-helper#contact-me-through) options
- If you'd like to be notified when the modules are completed, click the "Watch" button on the top right
- The project will be cleaned once the missing modules and moderation modules are finished, but like before you can still use it
